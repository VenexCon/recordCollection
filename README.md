# recordCollection

This is to record my process of solving the record collection challenege on FreeCodeCamp. To solve this I used the VS Code rather than the built-in browser provided. 

## Initial thoughts: 

4 conditional statements provided by freeCodeCamp, this will require focusing on the array sections of JS and if statements. My plan is to create if-else statements for the 4 conditions indiviudally and then decide on the best course of action to collate them into one updateFunction ().
